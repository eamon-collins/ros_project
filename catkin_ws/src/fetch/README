####

relevant files (ie don't modify/delete these unless you're certain):

in fetch/:
	tube.stl	-	mesh file specifying the tube that makes up the end of the catcher-arm. You probably won't have to touch this ever
	
	launch/mylaunch.launch 	-	my launch file, of note is that it currently starts a 'fetcher.py' node, sources the world description from fetch/worlds, and sources the robot description from turtlebot3_description/urdf/
	
	src/fetcher.py 	-	currently subscribes to the camera topic, finds circles in the image, and shows an updating picture of the image plus delineated circle

	worlds/* 	-	the different worlds, you can sub these in in mylaunch.launch, has a simpleworld plus all the test cases provided by Prof Elbaum


in turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/urdf/:
	turtlebot3_ball_waffle_pi.urdf.xacro	-	modified to have a movable arm with hollow cylinder at the end to "catch" the balls. sources tube from fetch/tube.stl

	turtlebot3_ball2_waffle_pi.urdf.xacro 	-	modified to have 2 rigid cylinders project from the turtlebot at an angle so as to catch balls
